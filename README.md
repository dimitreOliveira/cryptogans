# Usage

## Train
This script will train your models from scratch, but ir requires a `data/images` folder at root will the CryptoPunks images.
```bash
python3 train.py
```

## Gradio App (CryptoPunk generation)

### Using your own model
This requires you to have a `models` folder at root with a generator model.
```bash
python3 app.py
```

### Using a model from HuggingFace hub
This will download the generator model from HuggingFace hub and serve it.
```bash
python3 hf_app.py
```

## Streamlit App (CryptoPunk Captcha)

### Using your own model
This requires you to have a `models` folder at root with a generator model.
```bash
streamlit run captcha_app.py
```

### Using a model from HuggingFace hub
This will download the generator model from HuggingFace hub and serve it.
```bash
streamlit run hf_captcha_app.py
```
